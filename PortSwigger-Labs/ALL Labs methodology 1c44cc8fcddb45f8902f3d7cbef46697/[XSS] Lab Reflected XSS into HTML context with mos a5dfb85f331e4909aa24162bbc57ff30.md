since we have a search box lets insert a canary and look for where it appears in the source/DOM.

by injecting a comment sequence we can see that weâ€™re able to inject a comment sequence. 

since this lab is blocking most tags lets use intruder to see which ones we can use.

the only one that passed was body:

but the important one is the onresize tag. 

we can pass this through an iframe allowing us to create a onload event to have our iframe resized. 

the original source of the iframe with be our URL with the search query in the URL.
