lets visiting the site with no proxy, lets just map out the web app to get idea of itâ€™s functionality.

we can see it is a shopping application. with category filters at the top lets click on one of them with the proxy on.

now we know there is 2 columns. also for Oracle DB we always need a from table so we can use the built in table dual. 

now lets see which columns support a str type for our sql injection union attack.

we can see that the first column support str type. 

so now lets get tables names. in Oracle we dont use information_schema for DB info rather we have a tale called all_tables.

now that we found the table with possible username and password lets find the column names. 

now lets user the all_tab_columns to get columns name:

perfect now lets do select on that USERS table and concatenate the 2 string columns into one output.

Perfect so now we have password lets login.

perfect and there we have it another lab solved.
