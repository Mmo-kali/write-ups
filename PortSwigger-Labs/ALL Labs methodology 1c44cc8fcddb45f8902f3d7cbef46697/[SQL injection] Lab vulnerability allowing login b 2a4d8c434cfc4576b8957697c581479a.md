So i am dealing with a web application that has a vulnerability in allowing login by-pass one of the things i find useful when ever starting a lab is visiting the site with out a proxy on. 

- this allows me to map out the functionality of the site as well as get understanding of the layout.

website looks to be sometype of shop, i looked at the functionality of the site with the button in the top right corner and was able to get to a login page from the ‘My Account’ button

provided test valuse for username and password to capture the request with burp suite proxy, and foxy proxy. 

a vulnerability can exist based of off the way the application handles it’s logic of logging in users. 

so most likley what happening here is the parameters passed to the application are being inserted in the a query as such 

```sql
SELECT from Users WHERE username='test' AND password='test'
-- if this provides and type of response then the user will be logged in 
```

so by using a comment Sequence in sql with the comment sequence in sql we can by pass the logic of application, by providing any valid user name and a comment sequence at end of the username parameter. 

```sql
SELECT from Users WHERE username='administrator'-- AND password='test'

THIS IS THE NEW QUERY
```
