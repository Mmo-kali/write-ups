So for CSRF, we can manually generate the POC or use a burp suite tool for the CSRF payload generator using one of the engagement tools we’re provided. 

so lets go to the site login with the provided credintials and go change this account email and capture this request.

lets breakdown this payload some more.

so the form tag in HTML is used for submitting information. when we add in the `action` attribute this provides the URL that the for is supposed to use for handling this information, so in this case we can provide the URL that is used to change the email in the action attribute.

the `method`  attribute is used to specify the actual method we will be using to submit this form in our case it is a post method.

then for the 2 inputs one is for the value of the email we’re going to be changing this persons account to. 

then secondly the submit button for us to submit this for. 

but with the button doesn’t that mean the form would require user interaction? 

actually no. 

because of this code snippet here:

The code changes the browser's URL to the homepage without reloading the page, then submits the first form on the webpage. 

and there we have it lab solved.
