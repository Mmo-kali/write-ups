i think the vulnerability will appear whenever we select a product and check the stock similarly to the API lab.

so I was correct whenever we make a post request to this external API we’re sending data via a XML document. 

lets try to create our own external entity to allow it to return use the value /etc/passwd.

and there we have it we’re able to create an XML entity that is being loaded from another file basically an external entity whose Document type Definition occurs outside of the XML file.  

**And there we go lab solved:**
