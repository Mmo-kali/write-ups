When defending against clickjacking in CSS, it's common to use 'top' and 'bottom' rather than 'height' and 'width'. This is because 'top' and 'bottom' can help to position an element in relation to its nearest positioned ancestor. This can be useful in preventing a malicious actor from overlaying a clickable element over your intended button or link. Using 'height' and 'width' alone might not protect against this, because they just control the size of the element, not its position on the page.
